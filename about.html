                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2003, Prestige Homes began with a simple mission: to make real estate transactions transparent and stress-free...</p>

                <h2>The Right Partner for a Modern Market</h2>
  
                  <p>The Davis family was ready to upgrade, but their last selling experience ten years ago was slow and frustrating. They dreaded the months of waiting and the endless back-and-forth.</p>
                   <p>This time, they partnered with Prestige Homes. The difference was night and day.</p>
                    <p>We didn't just stick a sign on the lawn. We used professional photography, 3D virtual tours, and targeted digital ads to put their home in front of thousands of ideal buyers. Our data-driven pricing strategy ensured they didn't leave money on the table. Instead of months, they had multiple competitive offers within two weeks.</p>
